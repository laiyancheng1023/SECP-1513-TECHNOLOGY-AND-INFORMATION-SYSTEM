| **1** | **Industry Visit 1 (UTM Digital Day),Assignment 1** | On 5th November 2025, my team and I attended the UTM Digital Open Day, where I gained valuable insights into the role of AI in the modern era. A highlight was the presentation by Mr. Ronald Chong from Canon Marketing regarding AI's impact on healthcare and safety. I also interviewed the UTM Digital Department staff, which provided me with a deeper understanding of university infrastructure, including e-learning platforms and the UTM Smart system. |
| **2** | **PC Assemble Lab** | It was fun! I'm so glad to have this oppornity to join the lab. It's such a great feeling when my perspective shifts. It is beacause I finally know how to assemble the PC and see how the computer component look likes such as power supply, RAM card, as well as the connection between each wire and machine. After we the lab session had ended,we also take some quiz about the lab we had learned.It was quite fun to join this lab!!|
| **3** | **Industry Talk 1,Assignment 2** | This talk revealed how PPG functions as an "invisible giant," impacting everything from consumer goods to aerospace. I learned about their "Plan, Build, Run" operational model and their strategic migration toward a "Cloud-only" infrastructure. A key takeaway was the contrast between academic "clean data" and the massive, complex datasets found in the industry, which demand advanced SQL and database management skills. This experience has motivated me to strengthen my database expertise now to prepare for my Final Year Project and future career. |
| **4** | **Industry Talk 2,Assigment 3** | This session fundamentally shifted my perspective on success in Computer Science. I learned that technical proficiency must be balanced with strong communication and adaptability. Comparing Waterfall and Agile methodologies to lifestyle planning taught me the importance of staying resilient when facing unexpected challenges. Over the next four years, I am committed to a dual-path of growth: refining my coding expertise while actively strengthening my teamwork and problem-solving abilities to build effective, real-world applications. |
| **5** | **Industry Visit 2,Assignment 4** |Through this visit to Johor Port, I gained deep insights into the logistics industry and the sophisticated management of company workflows. I was particularly impressed by their digital ecosystem, enterprise systems, and secure port access protocols. Learning about their resilient infrastructure and cybersecurity measures was eye-opening, as it showed me how advanced technology and specialized techniques are applied in a real-world industrial setting. Additionally, I was surprised to learn about the diverse career paths available for fresh graduates and the internship opportunities offered to university students. It was an inspiring and educational experience!|
| **6** | **Design Thinking** | Through this design thinking project, I learned a lot about the process of creating a real interactive application on my own. Although the application we developed was only a prototype, I was still amazed that it could actually be created by my group members and me through teamwork and collaboration. After completing the prototype, we were required to write a report from multiple perspectives, such as the feedback session, testing phase, and the purpose of creating the application. I found this part especially interesting because it clearly showed how our efforts and ideas were reflected in the final prototype.Finally, we presented our prototype in class. To be honest, I felt quite nervous when it was my turn to explain the solution part of our prototype. However, in the end, my teammates and I successfully completed the presentation, and it turned out to be a wonderful and satisfying experience.|
