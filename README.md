| **2** | **PC Assemble Lab** | It is funnny! I'm so glad to have this oppornity to join the lab. It's such a great feeling when my perspective shifts. It is beacause I finally know how to assemble the PC and see how the computer component look likes such as power supply, RAM card, as well as the connection between each wire and machine. After we the lab session had ended,we also take some quiz about the lab we had learned.It was quite fun to join this lab!!|

| **4** | **Industry Talk 2** | Explored the shift from Waterfall to Agile methodologies. Learned that success in CS requires a balance of technical coding, communication, teamwork, and problem-solving. |
| **5** | **Industry Visit 2** | From this visit,I had learned more about the knowledge for logistics and behind how they manage their company and working progressing so well.In this Johor Port's visit,i had learned more about its diigital ecosystem,enterprise systems and secure port acess as well as its resillient infrastructure and cybersecurity.I was amazed and shocked by their company using different kind of technology and techniques in their industry.Beside, I'm surprised that Johor Port company also provide variety of careers and and working opportunity for freshmans who had just graduates,they also provide a opportunity for student in university to work as a intern!That was fun for the whole visit!! |
| **6** | **Design Thinking** | Through this design thinking project, I learned a lot about the process of creating a real interactive application on my own. Although the application we developed was only a prototype, I was still amazed that it could actually be created by my group members and me through teamwork and collaboration. After completing the prototype, we were required to write a report from multiple perspectives, such as the feedback session, testing phase, and the purpose of creating the application. I found this part especially interesting because it clearly showed how our efforts and ideas were reflected in the final prototype.Finally, we presented our prototype in class. To be honest, I felt quite nervous when it was my turn to explain the solution part of our prototype. However, in the end, my teammates and I successfully completed the presentation, and it turned out to be a wonderful and satisfying experience.|
